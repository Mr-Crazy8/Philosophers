can i singal core process creat more then 1 Thread

can we force the cpu core to creat more then 1 Thread

what do you mean that Process is Heavy-weight and Thread is Light-weight


what do you mean that Process is Higher creation overhead and Thread is Lower creation overhead

what you mean by Theoretical Limits if The number isn't directly limited by cores


what do you mean by Optimal Thread/Process Count


so in Context Switching it use Thread Control Block (TCB)

do i need to alloc for Thread-Local Storage (TLS) and if it will be in the heap and the heap is Shared Between Threads 


can we make a signal Thread core to be multiThread 



do we have one TCB for each thread in a process ?







explain Simultaneous Multithreading 
what is Pipelines in a Physical Core


you say that "Architectural state (registers, program counter, etc.) is duplicated for each logical core."
how does (SMT / Hyperâ€‘Threading) do that
